Add a line from "Star Trek: The Next Generation" to your dashboard. 

== Description ==

Like Matt's "Hello Dolly" plugin "Make It So" echoes lines from our cultural history straight to your dashboard. Only unlike "Hello Dolly" and like my other plugin "He's Dead, Jim", "Make It So" speaks to your inner nerd by echoing lines from "Star Trek: The Next Generation."

== Installation ==

1. Upload `make_it_so.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Adjust your tunic

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I want to keep "Hello Dolly" as well? =

I've designed "Make It So" to send it's output to another line, so they play well together. See the screenshots. 

= What if I want to keep "Hello Dolly" as well as "He's Dead, Jim"? =

They will all play well together. See the screenshots. World leaders could learn a thing or two here.

== Screenshots ==

1. "Make it So" on its own. 
2. "Make it So" playing nicely with "Hello Dolly".
3. "Make it So" playing nicely with both "Hello Dolly" and "He's Dead, Jim".
4. "Shut up, Wesley!"
